Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of 
classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin 
professor at Hampde(@@@@@@@@@@@(((((((((n-Syd))))))))ney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, 
discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 
"de Finibus Bonorum et M
==========alorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This 
book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of 
Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32
The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is rep^^^^^^^^^^^^^roduced below for those interested. 
Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also 
reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham
